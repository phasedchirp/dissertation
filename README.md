Dissertation-related category learning modeling

Most of this is semi-functional now. 

If you see egregious math errors (ignoring my terrible assumptions about probability distributions) feel free to point them out.

If you have suggestions for alternatives to my terrible assumptions about probability distributions, that'd be pretty cool too.

* update function for components
* update functions for mixtures:
  - Competitive update, updating only the most probable component

#### Not working:

* update functions for mixtures:
  - Update all categories weighted by posterior probability
